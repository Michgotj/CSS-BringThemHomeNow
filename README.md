This is PURE CSS canvas, in which I depicted the horrors faced by **Ariel** and **Kfir Bibas**, who have been kidnapped and trapped in Hamas tunnels for over 200 days, since October 7th.
The painting illustrates the contrast between the calm and chaotic atmosphere outside, highlighting the terror lurking beneath the ground.
The artwork captures the profound fear they experience, evoking a sense of urgency and the need for their rescue.
