In this CSS project, I depicted the horrors faced by Ariel and Kfir Bibi, who have been kidbapped and trapped in Hamas' tunnels for over 200 days. The painting illustrates the contrast between the calm and chaotic atmosphere outside, highlighting the terror lurking beneath the ground. The artwork captures the profound fear they experience, evoking a sense of urgency and the need for their rescue.
